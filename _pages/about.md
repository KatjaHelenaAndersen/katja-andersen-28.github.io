I’m a first-year Ph.D. student in Econometrics and Data Science at the Department of Economics at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). I received both my BSc and MSc in Economics from the University of Southern Denmark (SDU). In 2026, I am planning to spend an academic spring at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

I am currently working on the project "Beyond the Paycheck: Insights into the effect of Unemployment, Organisational Change, and Job Security on Mental Health". 
More broadly, I am interested in the role of economic policy in promoting health, and I aim to continue advancing research in this field throughout my career.

When I’m not working on my research, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, exploring new hobbies such as cycling and classical singing. My greatest passion, however, is aerial fitness.
