**Abtract**:
Recent evidence using state-of-the-art causal inference techniques generally agree that unem-
ployment harms mental health. Estimating the causal effect of unemployment on mental health
is challenging due to reverse causality and joint determination, in that people with poor mental
health may very well be likely to have longer and/or more frequent unemployment. Previous
research has shown that the Danish Unemployment Insurance Act, which reduced the number
of years an individual could receive benefits by 2 years, had a considerable effect on unem-
ployment. However the effect of this legislation on mental health is yet to be quantified. We
evaluate this legislation using a difference-in-difference design to estimate the effect of this Act
on subsequent mental health and examine if duration of unemployment is the underlying factor
driving this effect. These results provide an estimation of the mental health-related costs of
this legislative change. Such costs should be considered in future legislative discussions, as any
economic benefits could be negated by the ensuing burden on the healthcare system.
